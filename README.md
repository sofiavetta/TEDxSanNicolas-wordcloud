# TEDxSanNicolas Word Cloud

This Python script was part of an experiment among 500 attendants of TEDxSanNicolás 2019. They were told to fill a Google form with some concepts or ideas they find certain and uncertain. With these responses, I made a simple text analysis with wordcloud and nltk Python libraries in order to arrive to some conclusion. I found that people feel that math, science, love and death are certain things while the future, universe and life itself are completely uncertain.

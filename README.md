# TEDxSanNicolas Wordcloud

This Python script was part of an experiment among the 500 attendants of TEDxSanNicolás 2019. They were told to fill a Google form with some concepts or ideas they find certain and uncertain. With these responses, I made simple text analysis with wordcloud and nltk Python libraries in order to arrive to some conclusion. We found that people feel that **math**, **science**, **love** and **death** are certain things while the **future**, **universe**, **people** and **politics** are completely uncertain. These results were shown to the public in the *Community Talk* during the event.
